This project is conducting under the supervision of Omar Nada at the Sharpest Minds fellowship program.

# Introduction and Motivation

One of the first things to do while planning a trip is to book a good place to stay. Booking a hotel online can be an overwhelming task with thousands of hotels to choose from, for every destination. Motivated by the importance of these situations, we decided to work on the task of recommending hotels to users. We used Expediaâ€™s hotel recommendation dataset, which has a variety of features that helped us achieve a deep understanding of the process that makes a user choose certain hotels over others. The aim of this hotel recommendation task is to predict and recommend five hotel clusters to a user that he/she is more likely to book given hundred distinct clusters.


# Dataset

We have used the Expedia Hotel Recommendation dataset from Kaggle. The dataset, which had been collected in the 2013-2014 time-frame, consists of a variety of features that could provide us great insights into the process user go through for choosing hotels. The training set consists of 37,670,293 entries and the test set contains 2,528,243 entries. Apart from this, the dataset also provide some latent features for each of the destinations recorded in the train and test sets. The data is anonymized and almost all the fields are in numeric format. The goal is to predict 5 hotel clusters where a user is more likely to stay, out of a total of 100 hotel clusters. The problem has been modeled as a ranked multi-class classification task. Missing data, ranking requirement, and the curse of dimensionality are the main challenges posed by this dataset
